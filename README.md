# My-Scientific-Life-Theory
I believe that life cannot be explained by current physical and chemical laws alone. . Although I fully support the conservation laws. I believe that these laws cannot fully account for the origin and behavior of living things. Something is missing. I call this missing factor “life elements” or “life spirit.”
